\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Dr. Matthias MÃ¼nnich for his support throughout the project and his constant efforts to set up the submesoscale experiments. Furthermore, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Nicolas Gruber and Prof. Dr. Norbert Frank for their valuable advice and the opportunity to work on this thesis in the Environmental Physics group at ETH Zurich. I am grateful for the pleasant work atmosphere and the great time I spent with everyone from UP. My special thanks go to Luke and Cara who shared the office with me and answered patiently tons of questions. Finally, I would like to thank my family for their generous support and my girlfriend for her constant encouragement.
