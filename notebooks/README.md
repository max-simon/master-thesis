# Notebooks


## Horizontal Grids

*The notebook is called [grids.ipynb](grids.ipynb).*

This notebook creates additional grid data, i.e. a boolean mask for defining the analysis domain and a distance map which contains the distance to coast for each pixel. Further, a visualisation of the two horizontal grids is created. The following figures are created in this notebook:
- Figure 2.1 Horizontal grids


## Mesoscale Eddies

*The notebook is called [eddies.ipynb](eddies.ipynb).*

The notebook includes all calculations regarding eddy detection statistics (chapter 3.1.1), eddy kinetic energy (chapter 3.1.2) and the density anomaly of mesoscale eddies (chapter 3.1.2). The following figures are created in this notebook:
- Figure 3.1: Distribution of eddy radius
- Figure 3.2: Ratio of cyclonic to anticyclonic tracks
- Figure 3.3: Eddy Kinetic Energy
- Figure 3.5: Offshore density anomaly
- Figure 3.6: Relative increase in offshore EKE
- Figure A.8: Eddy radius with distance from coast
- Figure A.10: Offshore density anomaly (increased depth range)


## Strength of currents

*The notebook is called [currents.ipynb](currents.ipynb).*

The notebook calculates the strength of the California Current and California Undercurrent for a domain similar to [Rudnick et al (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661116302075) (chapter 3.1.2). The following figures are created in this notebook:
- Figure A.9 California Current and Undercurrent strength


## Submesoscale Fronts

*The notebook is called [submeso-fronts.ipynb](submeso-fronts.ipynb).*

The notebook implements the detection algorithm for submesoscale fronts (chapter 2.4). Further, it creates figures to visualize the appearance of submesoscale fronts (chapter 3.2.1) and the detection results (chapter 3.2.2). The following figures are created in this notebook:
- Figure 3.7: Snapshot of submesoscale fronts in HR
- Figure 3.8: Snapshot of submesoscale fronts in MR
- Figure 3.9: Vertical section of submesoscale fronts
- Figure 3.10: Instabilities in submesoscale fronts
- Figure 3.11: Area covered by submesoscale fronts
- Figure A.1: Detection results for HR in winter: I
- Figure A.2: Detection results for HR in winter: II
- Figure A.3: Detection results for HR in winter: III
- Figure A.4: Detection results for HR in summer
- Figure A.5: Detection results for MR in winter: I
- Figure A.6: Detection results for MR in winter: II
- Figure A.7: Detection results for different sigma_lat


## Eddy Quenching

*The notebook is called [eddy-quenching.ipynb](eddy-quenching.ipynb).*

The notebook calculates vertical sections of an observable (e.g. density), calculates the eddy-induced total nitrate flux and visualizes the flux (chapter 3.3.1). The following figures are created in this notebook:
- Figure 3.15: Eddy-induced total nitrate flux


## Eddy Composites

*The notebook is called [composites.ipynb](composites.ipynb).*

The notebook creates figures related to eddy composites. Eddy composites were used to show the anomaly of surface chlorophyll (chapter 3.3.1), the vertical structure of anomalies in mesoscale eddies (chapter 3.1.2) and the three-dimensional anomaly of the vertical velocity (chapter 3.2.2). The following figures are created in this notebook:
- Figure 3.4: Vertical structure of temperature anomaly
- Figure 3.12: Vertical velocity anomaly in HR
- Figure 3.13: Vertical velocity anomaly in MR
- Figure 3.14: Average surface CHL anomaly


## Biological Productivity

*The notebook is called [primary-prod.ipynb](primary-prod.ipynb).*

The notebook integrates NPP over depth, creates the corresponding visualisations and calculates the differences between MR and HR (chapter 3.3.2). The following figures are created in this notebook:
- Figure 3.16: Spatial distribution of NPP
- Figure 3.17: Relative change of NPP with distance from coast
- Figure 3.18: Hovm√∂ller diagram of NPP
- Figure A.11: Temporal evolution of NPP difference
